**About this game:**

This is a simple sidescrolling game written in Java that I spent one week creating soon after completing my BSc in Comp Sci. It is very basic. Do not expect anything near something with the polish of a published game.

Download the game [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6ORgCD1wL0_SG93RkZEbnozX3c/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-pdlPyWcgV2TyrECQJmPgeg).
