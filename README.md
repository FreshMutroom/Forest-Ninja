**About this game:**

This is a very barebone sidescrolling game written in Java that I spent exactly one week creating soon after completing my BSc in Comp Sci. It is very basic. Do not expect anything near something with the polish of a published game.

Download the game [**here**](https://goo.gl/Qv22fK).
